# Faker: Scala

Realistic sample value generators for Scala.

## Inspiration

While arbitrary value generation is useful, testing often profits from realistic samples. This library aims to provide generators for email addresses, geographical locations, person names, phone numbers, universal resource identifiers (URI), and more.

It takes cues from these similar projects for other languages:

- [faker-ruby/faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker)
- [Data::Faker](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Faker)

And means to fill gaps left by those for Scala which haven't seen recent activity:

- [dunnhumby/data-faker](https://github.com/dunnhumby/data-faker)
- [justwrote/scala-faker](https://github.com/justwrote/scala-faker)
- [therealadam/scala-faker](https://github.com/therealadam/scala-faker)
